# Data Visualization Generator

![Data Visualization Generator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COS301-SE-2020/Data-Visualisation/master/img/com.png)

## Description

Big Data is an ever-growing source of information, with governments and corporations generating more Big Data than ever.
It proves to be extremely valuable for companies and governments to be able to extract trends and patterns from this data and use this information to better prepare and/or optimize any services they offer.

This repository represents the visualisation of Big Data. However, the catch comes in where, instead of manually creating these visualisations of Big Data, an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) will be implemented and let the user be able to select/choose the best visualisation of the given data, be it a graph/chart/scatter plot etc.

> I am currently studying third year Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. Our work provided many challenges, requiring us to come up with effective and efficient solutions to different problems - developing our critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We have also been exposed to a variety of programming languages which we were expected to code in fluently, which allowed me to build a collection of programming languages.

###### Demo 1
* Front-end: Display dashboard functionality and a bit of EditDashboard. Unit tests for both and also a unit test for DisplayGraph.
* Continuous Integration: CircleCI setup.

###### Demo 2
